 - Finish collision handling
  -> Goal collision not picked up
  -> Boundary collisions glitch some of the time when velocity < height
  -> Top boundary collision sets position strangely 
  -> Collision of ball with bat is more complex
  
 - Make physics scaling dynamic (not bound to 800x600 1:1 pixel grid)
 - Issue: keylistener not effective
