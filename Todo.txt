 - Finish collision handling for ball
 - Input sampling
 - Make physics scaling dynamic (not bound to 800x600 1:1 pixel grid)
 - Distinguish between GameObject subclasses for handleCollisions
  -> don't bother checking if bat objects have collided with each other or
     themselves
 - Be able to return score condition from collision handling methods
 - Issue with bottom-boundary collision: batRight phases inside it
